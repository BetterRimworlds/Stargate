Please post all bug reports on the GitHub repo, if possible.

The Stargate system allows you to transport materials over the great distances between colonies, both off-world and on.

In other words, you can transfer your pawns and items across Savegames on the same machine.

Please make sure that the savegames are both at the same version of Rimworld, or crazy things can happen, including
softly corrupting your save (Your savegame will error out until the incompatible Pawns / Things are destroyed or sent
back through the Stargate).

**ALERT: The transdimensional construction of an Offworld Stargate has *devastating* consequences for all higher 
lifeforms on the map!**

WARNING: This mod uses the Rimworld Base Save Functionality in ways that it was never designed to support, mainly saving
         specific things into a separate file instead of saving everything on the map to one file at once. Because of this
         there may be adverse effects. The main one that I have found is that after traveling through the Stargate Social
         opinions relating to that colonist will be lost, they will effectively be meeting everyone for the first time 
         again. At this time I do not know of a practical way to resolve this issue.

Forked from Jaxxa's ED-Stargate (but only ~100 lines remain of the original code).
